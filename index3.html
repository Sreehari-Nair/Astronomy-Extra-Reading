        <div><p><b>Atmosphere is a very essential part of our lives, it helps us to breathe, keeps our body intact with the help of gravity and is a very 
            essential part for human survival , now in the previous page, we talked about the composition of the atmosphere. Now, it is very specific 
            number because the Carbon-Dioxide traps heat radiated by the Sun to ensure a warm climate so naturally, we don't need a huge amount of it 
            in our atmosphere. When we see sattelite images of the Earth which we will show is the Nitrogen fo the atmosphere, it feeds the plants that
            feed us food and consists of 70% of the Earth's atmosphere. And finally, Oxygen, the breath of life, our body breathes Oxygen and Nitrogen and use it for energy, well that is biology and we
             are not here to speak biology. See you in  the next page!!</b> </p></div>
